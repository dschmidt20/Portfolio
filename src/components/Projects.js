        <h3>Put Me In, Coach</h3>
        <p>
          Accessed an external API of over 19,000 MLB players to gather data to
          allow for lineup creation across every era of baseball with percentile
          rankings, as well as a batter vs. pitcher simulation to experiment
          with who would have the advantage in a hypothetical matchup. Built
          custom algorithms using my knowledge and passion for the game of
          Baseball to show the most accurate potential outcomes in the
          simulation.

          Created a place for landlords, homeowners, or property management to
          track and create appointments for the tasks at each property by
          partnering with service providers who use the site. Built two separate
          dashboards depending on if the user is a property owner or service
          provider.
